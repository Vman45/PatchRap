*) Series-Parallel motor splitter board should be produced to improve single-driver motor holding torque.
*) Splitter should accommodate a 9-pin header, allowing a more convenient jumper connection to ground.
*) Ethernet connector footprint does not accommodate correct distance for plastic mounting tabs.
*) Should probably commission a factory order of more modern connectors with LEDs, at a reasonable price.

*) Optional extra internal layers should be added for additional stepper motor current carrying capability and reduced VExt/GND voltage drops.
