_ColorCode_
Label background color codes identify subordinate standards followed, as well risk of equipment damage upon improper connection, in order. End-user functionality should be kept to BLUE, BLACK, WHITE, or lower risk networks.

YELLOW (ffff00) - RESERVED

MAGENTA (ff00ff) - High-voltage high-current may be applied to any pin. Stepper motor, linear PSU.

PURPLE (8000ff) - RESERVED

ORANGE (ff8000) - GenericIO Compliant. High-voltage/current peripherial. Hot-end.

GREEN (00ff00) - GenericIO Compliant. Peripherial. Limit switch, thermistor.

TEAL (00ffff) - RESERVED

BLUE (0000ff) - GenericIO Compliant. Digital logic or high-reliability network. All power <5V. All signals <3.3V. Fuse, resistor, diode, transformer, and transient-voltage suppression may be in place.

BLACK (000000) - DigitalIO Compliant. All pins strictly limited to <3.3V. End-user digital peripherial. Graphical display.
WHITE (ffffff) - GenericIO Compliant. All pins strictly limited to <3.3V. End-user analog peripherial. Thermistor.



_Checkboxes_
Whitespace is provided as a multi-use checkbox, or other arbitrary label. Reading from left-to-right, a vertical line "|" should only be the last symbol if cable connections at both ends were most recently known to be valid.

Mark "|" when connection is validated by continutiy test. Mark "-" or "." or "x" when either end of the cable is not certainly attached to correct device type.
